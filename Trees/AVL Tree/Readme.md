# AVL Tree:
AVL tree is **a self-balancing Binary  Search Tree  (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes**

								Height balanced binary search tree.

### Balance Factor 
	Balance Factor(bf) = Height of left subtree - Height of right subtree.
								
									bf = {-1,0,1}


In AVL tree, every node should be balanced, else tree is imbalanced.

### Rotation at time of insertion.

  **Single Rotation**
  - LL Rotation.
 - RR Rotation.
 
 **Double Rotation,**
 
 - LR Rotation.
 - RL Rotation.
